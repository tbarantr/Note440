# Chapter 5: Replication: weak consistency model protocols
* enforcing order is expensive
* Eventual consistency
  - Nodes can for some time diverge from each other, but that eventually they will agree on the value
  - Eventual consistency with probabilistic guarantees
    - detect conflicting writes at some later point, but does not guarantee that the results are equivalent to some correct sequential execution
    - Amazon's Dynamo
  - Eventual consistency with strong guarantees
    - guarantees that the results converge to a common value equivalent to some correct sequential execution
* CRDT (convergent replicated data types) are data types that guarantee convergence to the same value in spite of network delays, partitions and message reordering
* The CALM (consistency as logical monotonicity) conjecture equates logical monotonicity with convergence.
  - help to decide when and where to apply coordination techniques

## Reconciling different operation orders
* Scenario 1: each partition handles distinct set of clients
```
[Clients]   - > [A]
--- Partition ---
[Clients]   - > [B]
--- Partition ---
[Clients]   - > [C]
```
```
[A] \
    --> [merge]
[B] /     |
          |
[C] ----[merge]---> result
```

* Scenario 2: without coordination, each host receive updates in different order
```
[Clients]  --> [A]  1, 2, 3
[Clients]  --> [B]  2, 3, 1
```

## Amazon's Dynamo
* eventually consistent, highly available key-value store
* prioritizes availability over consistency
* replicas may diverge from each other when values are written
* there is a read reconciliation phase that attempts to reconcile differences between replicas before returning the value back to the client
* basis for Linkedin's Voldemort, Facebook's Cassandra and Basho's Riak
```
[ Client ]
    |
( Mapping keys to nodes )
    |
    V
[ Node A ]
    |     \
( Synchronous replication task: minimum durability )
    |        \
[ Node B]  [ Node C ]
    A
    |
( Conflict detection; asynchronous replication task:
  ensuring that partitioned / recovered nodes recover )
    |
    V
[ Node D]
```
### Consistent hashing
* key-to-node mapping can be calculated on client

### Partial quorums
* test
