# Chapter 3: Time and order
## Total and partial order
* properties:
  - transitivity
  ```
  if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c
  ```
  - antisymmetry
  ```
  if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c
  ```
  - totality
  ```
  a ≤ b or b ≤ a for all a, b in X
  ```
  - reflexivity
  ```
  a ≤ a for all a in X
  ```
* partial order:
  - not every pair of elements needs to be comparable
  - transitive, antisymmetric and reflexive
  - in the context of DS: Neither the network nor independent nodes make any guarantees about relative order; but at each node, you can observe a local order.
* total order:
  - a binary relation that defines an order for every element in some set
  - transitive, antisymmetric and total


## What is time?
* an integer counter
* clock: approximates the value of the integer counter in physically distant places via some physical property without communicating it directly
* usage
  - interpretation: the absolute value of a timestamp can be interpreted as a datetime; to be compared with real-world event
  - order: to determine or enforce ordering; as a tie breaker
  - duration: define boundary condidtions for algorithms (high latency vs node failure); as a failure-detector/time-out

## Does time progress at the same rate everywhere?
### Global-clock assumption
* there is a global clock of perfect accuracy, and that everyone has access to that clock
  - assuming that clocks start at the same value and never drift apart
* source of total order
* in reality, clock synchronization is limited by
  - computer clock accuracy
  - latency of clock synchronization protocol
  - the nature of spacetime
* real world example
  - Facebook's Cassandra
  - Google's Spanner (TrueTime API)

### Local-clock assumption
* each machine has its own clock, but there is no global clock
  - cannot meaningfully compare timestamps from two different machines, but can use timestamps to order events on a single machine, can use timeout
* partial order

### No-clock assumption
* track causality using counters and communication
  - cannot use timeouts, but can determine order
* a counter per machine for partial order; communication for ordering across systems
* precision at which events can be ordered is bounded by communication latency
* real world example (vector clock)
  - Basho's Riak
  - Linkedin's Voldemort

## Logical clocks
### Lamport clock
* Each process maintains a counter
  - Whenever a process does work, increment the counter
  - Whenever a process sends a message, include the counter
  - When a message is received, merge the two counters to `max(local_t, received_t)`, then increment the counter
* Lamport clocks define a partial order. If `t(a) < t(b)`, either
  - `a` happened before `b`
  - `a` is incomparable with `b`
* can not be used to determine a causal relationship

### Vector clock
* Each process maintains a vector `[t1, t2, ...]` of N logical clocks - one per each node
  - Whenever a process does work, increment the clock value of the node in the vector
  - Whenever a process sends a message, include the full vector of clocks
  - When a message is received, update the `i`-th element in the vector to be `max(local_t[i], received_t[i])`, then increment the clock value of the node in the vector
* can be used to determine a causal relationship

## Failure detectors (timeout)
* use timeout to infer node failure
* failure detector used to abstract away the exact timing assumptions
* failure detectors are implemented using heartbeat messages and timers
* properties
  - completeness
    - strong: Every crashed process is eventually suspected by every correct process.
    - weak: Every crashed process is eventually suspected by some correct process.
  - accuracy
    - strong: No correct process is suspected ever.
    - weak: Some correct process is never suspected.

## Time, order and performance
* Total order is possible but expensive
* Time/order/synchronicity might not be necessary if we do not care about each intermediate results
* Sometimes, the cheaper "best effort" estimate is acceptable
